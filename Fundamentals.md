## Regression vs Classification

Use classification for tasks where the goal is to predict categorical outcomes or class labels. Example: Predicting if an email is spam or not spam, classifying animals as cats or dogs.

Use regression for tasks where the goal is to predict a continuous numerical value. Example: Predicting house prices, temperature, or sales numbers.


## Linear Regression Model

A linear regression model is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm used to predict a continuous output (dependent variable) based on one or more input features (independent variables). It assumes a linear relationship between the input variables and the output.
