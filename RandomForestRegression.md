# RandomForestRegression

## Overview

Random Forest Regression is an ensemble learning technique that uses multiple decision trees to improve the accuracy and robustness of regression models. It is an extension of Random Forest, which is commonly used for both classification and regression tasks.


## How it Works

- Bootstrapping & Sampling: The algorithm creates multiple subsets of the original dataset by randomly selecting data points with replacement (this is called bootstrap sampling).

- Building Decision Trees: Each subset is used to train an individual decision tree, but at each split, only a random subset of features is considered to reduce correlation among trees.

- Averaging Predictions: Once all trees are trained, their individual predictions are averaged to obtain the final regression output.

## Key Features

- Reduces Overfitting: By averaging the predictions of multiple trees, Random Forest reduces overfitting that a single decision tree might suffer from.

- Handles Non-Linearity: It can model complex relationships between features and target variables.

- Handles Missing Values: It can work well even if some data points are missing.

- Feature Importance: It provides a measure of feature importance, which helps in feature selection.
